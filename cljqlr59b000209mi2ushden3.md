Okay, as someone who has been using decentralized social media for the past couple of days, here are my first thoughts:

Let us start with Nostr. While I understand it, I do not think it is going to catch on. Mastodon, along with most of the Fediverse, is simply garbage.

Those who defend the Fediverse argue that it's beneficial because you know the server admin and can appeal to them if you're wrongfully banned.

I prefer a faceless corporation handling bans and related matters. It is also frustrating to deal with the requirement of selecting the right server, as choosing the wrong one floods you with a bunch of pointless rules. Additionally, setting up a Mastodon instance on Windows machines is not easy. Though I could manage it on a WSL installation, it is clunky and does not meet my needs.

Another issue I have is seeing multiple posts by the same person. They cross post like it is Reddit, but there is no option to disable viewing cross posts. I have tried different clients, but none have solved this problem.

Initially, I expected Mastodon to be a distributed social media platform, similar to IPFS (if you've used that), where peer-to-peer file transfers occur without torrenting. However, Mastodon revolves around choosing the right server, which is crucial to the Mastodon experience.

I know Threads will have ActivityPub support, enabling integration with Mastodon. But due to Mastodon's federated nature, many server admins are preemptively de-federating from Threads' meta implementation of ActivityPub.

Some improvements I would suggest for Mastodon include not showing me duplicate posts. It is frustrating. If Threads does not kill Twitter, BlueSky seems to be a potential alternative. I have recently gained access to Threads, and the UI looks promising. Given Meta and Instagram's vast user base, it has a high chance of surpassing Twitter.

Other platforms often have too much "dev bullshit," meaning developers are reluctant to welcome normies or regular users. This gatekeeping behavior inhibits growth.

While researching Mastodon, I noticed some advocates likening it to email. However, that comparison does not hold up. Email providers do not significantly affect the user experience, but Mastodon heavily depends on the instance, its administrators, and the politics involved.

Mastodon's terrible user profile searchability is another major drawback. Threads, on the other hand, holds promise for improvement due to Zuckerberg's ability in running social media sites.

Personally, privacy concerns do not bother me much. I stopped caring about them after leaving the Linux/communist community in 2017. My online activities are no longer radical, and I use a smartphone without much concern for privacy.

One reason I am cautious about privacy is my K-pop Twitter posts. I worry about getting doxxed, but true doxxing, not just revealing my name, which is not doxxing in my view.

Threads already has an edge over BlueSky due to its integrated Instagram presence, making it easier for people to switch. Thus, Threads is likely to gain critical mass quickly. Although I appreciate BlueSky's interface and protocols, Threads' ActivityPub support will enable federation with Mastodon instances (assuming the admins of the instance allow it). Instagram's stability is more reassuring than a random Mastodon server suddenly shutting down.  
  
Regarding Threads, there are a few criticisms I have after using it. Firstly, the lack of search functionality beyond searching for people is quite disappointing. However, I trust that Zuck will address this issue. Despite the shortcomings, I believe Threads has the potential to reach critical mass quickly due to the presence of celebrities already on the platform, thanks to its integration with Instagram.

One more criticism I have about Threads is the absence of a clear distinction between the people I follow and the firehose of tweets. Currently, I am inundated with a constant stream of posts from people i do not follow, which is not ideal in my opinion.  
  
I tried TruthSocial, and while it's amusing to see Donald Trump's ads and tweets, the platform itself sucks. It constantly bombards me with notifications from [**http://disclose.tv**](http://disclose.tv), which I do not need.

In terms of my advocacy, I support either centralized or distributed social media networks. I do not believe federated decentralized social media networks will work well because they are often too developer-oriented and not user-friendly enough.

Oh, I just remembered one of the biggest issues with Mastodon and federated social media: the requirement to sign up for every single instance. It is not as simple as just using user @. For example, if I'm on [**http://mastodon.social**](http://mastodon.social) and interacting with someone from beehaw, even if we have the same name, my handle is @edriffles on [**http://Mastodon.social**](http://Mastodon.social), while theirs is @edriffles on [**http://beehaw.social**](http://beehaw.social) This can be confusing and goes against the practices that have been set up over the past 15 years.

Bluesky resolves this problem by using Decentralized Identifiers (DID) within domain DNS records. For example, it links to [edriffles.de](http://edriffles.de), so with the extension, it will directly take you to my Bluesky user. This address's identity confusion caused by usernames on mastodon which link to the instance you are on.

When old heads talk about going back to Usenet and newsgroups from the '90s, claiming it was not that hard, they overlook the fact that these platforms were far inferior to what we have today. We do not need to revert to UseNet and newsgroups.

In summary, some people believe the internet was ruined when mainstream users gained access to it. Consequently, they do not want to make it easy for newcomers to join new alternative social media platforms run by developers, such as Mastodon or BSKY.

These individuals often claim that the '90s were better, when heterosexual tech bros were not dominating the internet. While I cannot personally relate to that sentiment since I was not active on the internet until around 2008-2009, it is important to acknowledge that technology and society have evolved significantly. We cannot turn back time; normies exist, and they are a part of the internet. If platforms want to grow, they must cater to a wider audience. Even though I have an interest in tech hardware, I do not use Linux. I will not be running instances because of the heavy focus on needing to use the command line. It is not the '90s anymore, and we should not disregard the progress we have made. Developers should prioritize creating user-friendly graphical user interfaces even if it is for software that is being used to host a server.
