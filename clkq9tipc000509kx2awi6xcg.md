I must break the habit of letting others dictate my music taste. I have realized that I often succumb to peer pressure, allowing the opinions of others to unduly influence mine. As a result, I have neglected albums and artists that I might have otherwise enjoyed, assuming that if they are not well-liked, I will not like them either. This is a personal failing that I need to address.

One instance of this was when I labeled Jack Harlow as "cringe" despite having enjoyed his music when he was first gaining popularity. Due to this perception, I avoided listening to his music until recently, and even then, I only listened to "Gang Gang Gang" because I saw it as a meme song, overlooking its deeper meaning as an introspective track about unconditional love.

I now recognize that I was viewing his music through a negative lens because of the baggage I allowed myself to carry from my desire to fit in with others' opinions. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened, and I fear it won't be the last. Other artists have also been affected by my tendency to judge their music based on the behavior of their fans, making it hard for me to appreciate their prior work and look forward to their new releases.

To overcome this, I need to form my own opinions about music, free from the influence of others' reactions. It's time for me to stop seeking validation from other people and trust my judgment when it comes to an artist's music.

After giving it a chance, I thoroughly enjoyed Jack Harlow's album. I appreciated his flows, the creative interpolations he used, and the well-selected beats that complemented the tracks. I can confidently say that this album will find its place in my "I would listen again" playlist.  
  
From now on, I will continue to try to embrace my own music preferences and explore artists and albums without being swayed by external opinions. It's time to develop a genuine appreciation for music that resonates with me personally.
